Release checklist
=================

* Check ``git status``
* ``make check``
* LATER when configured properly: ``make pylint``
* ``tox``
* Update version in ``pygments/__init__.py``
* Check setup.py metadata: long description, trove classifiers
* Update release date/code name in ``CHANGES``
* ``git commit``
* Wait for the CI to finish
* ``make clean``
* ``python3 setup.py release bdist_wheel sdist``
* Check the size of the generated packages. If they're significantly different from the last release, check if the repository is in a modified state and that ``make clean`` was run.
* ``twine upload dist/Pygments-$NEWVER*``
* Check PyPI release page for obvious errors (like different file sizes!)
* ``git tag -a``
* Add new ``CHANGES`` heading for next version
* ``git commit``
* ``git push``, ``git push --tags``
* Add new release on https://github.com/pygments/pygments/releases
* Add new milestone on https://github.com/pygments/pygments/milestones if needed
* Write announcement and send to mailing list/python-announce
