- Pygments now tries to use the ``importlib.metadata`` module to
  discover plugins instead of the slower ``pkg_resources`` (#2155).  In
  particular, this largely speeds up the ``pygmentize`` script when
  the lexer is not specified.

  ``importlib.metadata`` is only available in the Python standard
  library since Python 3.8. For older versions, there exists an
  ``importlib_metadata`` backport on PyPI. For this reason, Pygments
  now defines a packaging extra ``plugins``, which adds a requirement
  on ``importlib_metadata`` if the Python version is older than
  3.8. Thus, in order to install Pygments with optimal plugin
  support even for old Python versions, you should do::

     pip install pygments[plugins]

  Pygments still falls back on ``pkg_resources`` if neither
  ``importlib.metadata`` nor ``importlib_metadata`` is found, but it
  will be slower.

- Silently ignore ``BrokenPipeError`` in the command-line interface
  (#2193).
- The ``HtmlFormatter`` now uses the ``linespans`` attribute for
  ``anchorlinenos`` if the ``lineanchors`` attribute is unset (#2026).
- The ``highlight``, ``lex`` and ``format`` functions no longer
  wrongly report "argument must be a lexer/formatter instance, not a
  class" in some cases where this is not the actual problem (#2123).
- Fix warnings in doc build (#2124).
- The ``codetagify`` filter now recognizes ``FIXME`` tags by default (#2150).
- The ``pygmentize`` command now recognizes if the ``COLORTERM``
  environment variable is set to a value indicating that true-color
  support is available.  In that case, it uses the ``TerminalTrueColorFormatter``
  by default (#2160)
- Remove redundant caches for filename patterns (#2153)
- Use new non-deprecated Pillow API for text bounding box in ``ImageFormatter``
  (#2198)
- Remove ``default_style`` (#930, #2183)
- Stop treating ``DeprecationWarnings`` as errors in the unit tests (#2196)

    (for ``xxx`` = ``html``, ``xml``, etc.) (#2103)
  * JSON: Support C comments in JSON (#2049). Note: This doesn't mean the JSON parser now supports JSONC or JSON5 proper, just that it doesn't error out when seeing a ``/* */`` or ``//`` style comment. If you need proper comment handling, consider using the ``JavaScript`` lexer.
  * LilyPond:

    - Fix incorrect lexing of names containing a built-in (#2071)

- Fix ``Groff`` formatter not inheriting token styles correctly (#2024)
- Various improvements to the CI (#2036)
- The Ada lexer has been moved to a separate file (#2117)
- When ``linenos=table`` is used, the ``<table>`` itself is now wrapped with a ``<div class="highlight">`` tag instead of placing it inside the ``<td class="code">`` cell (#632.) With this change, the output matches the documented behavior.

.. note::

  If you have subclassed ``HtmlFormatter.wrap``, you may have to adjust the logic.

- Recognize ``.leex`` as Elixir templates
- Fix incorrect variable being accessed (#1748)

- Updated `filename` handling in HTML formatter if `linenos='table'` (#1757)

  * Previously the filename would be emitted within the `<td>` holding the
    code, but outside the `<pre>`. This would invariably break the alignment
    with line numbers.
  * Now if `filename` is specified, a separate `<tr>` is emitted before the
    table content which contains a single `<th>` with `colspan=2` so it
    spans both the line number and code columns. The filename is still
    within `<span class="filename">...</span>` so any existing styles
    should still apply, although the CSS path may need to change.
  * For an example of the new output format see
    `table_cls_step_1_start_1_special_0_noanchor_filename.html`
    in the `tests/html_linenos_expected_output/` directory.
  * For more details and discussion see the issue
    https://github.com/pygments/pygments/issues/1757

- Added styles:

  * Gruvbox light+dark (#1763)

-------------
(released February 14, 2021)

- Added lexers:

  * AMDGPU (#1626)
  * CDDL (#1379, #1239)
  * Futhark (#1691)
  * Graphviz/DOT (#1657, #731)

- Updated lexers:

  * AutoIt: Support single quoted strings (#1667, #1663)
  * C/C++ & related: Fix mishandling ``*/`` (#1695)
  * Cocoa: Add builtin types (#1703)
  * Console (#1672)

  * Matlab:

    - Add support for class properties (#1466)
    - Update builtin functions (#1705)

  * Ruby: Better method name handling (#1531)
  * Stata: Updated keywords (#1470)

- Added styles:

  * Material (#1662)
  * Zenburn (#1659)

- The `pygmentize` script now uses `argparse`, all options should work
  as before

- Add `pygmentize -C` option to guess a lexer from content

- With this release, Pygments moves to a new internal testing system (#1649.)
  See ``Contributing.md`` for details. The main advantage of this new change
  is a much better test coverage of all existing example lexers. It also makes
  it much easier to add new test snippets.
- Make guessing prefer Python 3 lexer
- Do not guess MIME or SQL without reason
- Changed setuptools to use a declarative config through ``setup.cfg``.
  Building Pygments now requires setuptools 39.2+.
- Add markdown to MarkdownLexer aliases (#1687)
- Change line number handling

  * In ``<table>`` based output, the ``td.linenos`` element will have either a
    ``normal`` or ``special`` class attached. Previously, only ``special`` line
    numbers got a class. This prevents styles from getting applied twice -
    once via ``<pre>``, once via ``<span class="special">``. This also means
    that ``td.linenos pre`` is no longer styled, instead, use
    ``td.linenos .normal`` and ``td.linenos .special``.
  * In the "inline" style, the DOM element order was changed. The line number
    is added first, then the line is wrapped is wrapped by the highlighter.
    This fixes lines not being fully highlighted.
  * The visual output for inline and non-inline line numbers & highlighting,
    as well as class-based and inline styling is now consistent.
  * Line number styles are set to ``background-color: transparent`` and
    ``color: inherit`` by default. This works much better with dark styles
    which don't have colors set for line numbers.

    types.
  * Bash lexer now correctly highlights heredocs without preceding
    whitespace.
  * Vim lexer now highlights hex colors properly and knows a couple
    more keywords.

- New option ``hl_lines`` to HTML formatter, to highlight certain
  lines.

- New option ``prestyles`` to HTML formatter.

- New option *-g* to pygmentize, to allow lexer guessing based on
  filetext (can be slowish, so file extensions are still checked
  first).

- ``guess_lexer()`` now makes its decision much faster due to a cache
  of whether data is xml-like (a check which is used in several
  versions of ``analyse_text()``.  Several lexers also have more
  accurate ``analyse_text()`` now.

  * D, thanks to Kirk McDonald
  * MuPad, thanks to Christopher Creutzig

  * Vim Script, by Tim Hatch

- The HTML formatter now has a second line-numbers mode in which it
  will just integrate the numbers in the same ``<pre>`` tag as the
  code.

- The `CSharpLexer` now is Unicode-aware, which means that it has an
  option that can be set so that it correctly lexes Unicode
  identifiers allowed by the C# specs.

- Added a `RaiseOnErrorTokenFilter` that raises an exception when the
  lexer generates an error token, and a `VisibleWhitespaceFilter` that
  converts whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) into visible
  characters.

- Fixed the `do_insertions()` helper function to yield correct
  indices.

- The ReST lexer now automatically highlights source code blocks in
  ".. sourcecode:: language" and ".. code:: language" directive
  blocks.

- Improved the default style (thanks to Tiberius Teng). The old
  default is still available as the "emacs" style (which was an alias
  before).

- The `get_style_defs` method of HTML formatters now uses the
  `cssclass` option as the default selector if it was given.

- Improved the ReST and Bash lexers a bit.

  Pygments highlighting in Moin Wiki pages.

- Changed the exception raised if no suitable lexer, formatter etc. is
  found in one of the `get_*_by_*` functions to a custom exception,
  `pygments.util.ClassNotFound`. It is, however, a subclass of
  `ValueError` in order to retain backwards compatibility.

- Added a `-H` command line option which can be used to get the
  docstring of a lexer, formatter or filter.

- Made the handling of lexers and formatters more consistent. The
  aliases and filename patterns of formatters are now attributes on
  them.

- Added an OCaml lexer, thanks to Adam Blinkinsop.

- Made the HTML formatter more flexible, and easily subclassable in
  order to make it easy to implement custom wrappers, e.g. alternate
  line number markup. See the documentation.

- Added an `outencoding` option to all formatters, making it possible
  to override the `encoding` (which is used by lexers and formatters)
  when using the command line interface. Also, if using the terminal
  formatter and the output file is a terminal and has an encoding
  attribute, use it if no encoding is given.

- Made it possible to just drop style modules into the `styles`
  subpackage of the Pygments installation.

- Added a "state" keyword argument to the `using` helper.

- Added a `commandprefix` option to the `LatexFormatter` which allows
  to control how the command names are constructed.

- Added quite a few new lexers, thanks to Tim Hatch:

  * Java Server Pages
  * Windows batch files
  * Trac Wiki markup
  * Python tracebacks
  * ReStructuredText
  * Dylan
  * and the Befunge esoteric programming language (yay!)

- Added Mako lexers by Ben Bangert.
