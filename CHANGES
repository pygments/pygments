- Added a helper to "optimize" regular expressions that match one of many
  literal words; this can save 20% and more lexing time with lexers that
  highlight many keywords or builtins.

- New styles: "xcode" and "igor", similar to the default highlighting of
  the respective IDEs.

- The command-line "pygmentize" tool now tries a little harder to find the
  correct encoding for files and the terminal (#979).

- Added "inencoding" option for lexers to override "encoding" analogous
  to "outencoding" (#800).

- Added line-by-line "streaming" mode for pygmentize with the "-s" option.
  (PR#165)  Only fully works for lexers that have no constructs spanning
  lines!

- Added an "envname" option to the LaTeX formatter to select a replacement
  verbatim environment (PR#235).

  for speed (PR#205).

  a file based on content (PR#118).

  many more modules with less lexers per module.  Old modules are still around
  and re-export the lexers they previously contained.

- Python 3 lexer: add new exceptions from PEP 3151.

- Opa lexer: add new keywords (PR#170).

  literals (PR#176).

  * Nginx config files
  * Gnuplot plotting scripts
  * Clojure

  * C lexer highlights standard library functions now and supports C99
    types.
  * Bash lexer now correctly highlights heredocs without preceding
    whitespace.
  * Vim lexer now highlights hex colors properly and knows a couple
    more keywords.

- Added "Visual Studio" style.

- Updated markdown processor to Markdown 1.7.

  documented that tokenization with this lexer may raise exceptions.

- New option ``hl_lines`` to HTML formatter, to highlight certain
  lines.

- New option ``prestyles`` to HTML formatter.

- New option *-g* to pygmentize, to allow lexer guessing based on
  filetext (can be slowish, so file extensions are still checked
  first).

- ``guess_lexer()`` now makes its decision much faster due to a cache
  of whether data is xml-like (a check which is used in several
  versions of ``analyse_text()``.  Several lexers also have more
  accurate ``analyse_text()`` now.

------------
(codename Malzeug, released May 06, 2008)

  'PY' instead of 'C', since the latter resulted in several collisions
  with other packages.  Also, the special meaning of the *arg*
  argument to ``get_style_defs()`` was removed.

  (Needs the Python Imaging Library.)

  * Greatly improved the Haskell and OCaml lexers.
  * Improved the Bash lexer's handling of nested constructs.

  give options whose values contain commas or equals signs.

  * Redcode, thanks to Adam Blinkinsop
  * D, thanks to Kirk McDonald
  * MuPad, thanks to Christopher Creutzig
  * MiniD, thanks to Jarrett Billingsley
  * Vim Script, by Tim Hatch

- The HTML formatter now has a second line-numbers mode in which it
  will just integrate the numbers in the same ``<pre>`` tag as the
  code.

- The `CSharpLexer` now is Unicode-aware, which means that it has an
  option that can be set so that it correctly lexes Unicode
  identifiers allowed by the C# specs.

- Added a `RaiseOnErrorTokenFilter` that raises an exception when the
  lexer generates an error token, and a `VisibleWhitespaceFilter` that
  converts whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) into visible
  characters.

- Fixed the `do_insertions()` helper function to yield correct
  indices.

- The ReST lexer now automatically highlights source code blocks in
  ".. sourcecode:: language" and ".. code:: language" directive
  blocks.

- Improved the default style (thanks to Tiberius Teng). The old
  default is still available as the "emacs" style (which was an alias
  before).

- The `get_style_defs` method of HTML formatters now uses the
  `cssclass` option as the default selector if it was given.

- Improved the ReST and Bash lexers a bit.

- Fixed a few bugs in the Makefile and Bash lexers, thanks to Tim
  Hatch.

  Apache Config lexers.

  Pygments highlighting in Moin Wiki pages.

- Changed the exception raised if no suitable lexer, formatter etc. is
  found in one of the `get_*_by_*` functions to a custom exception,
  `pygments.util.ClassNotFound`. It is, however, a subclass of
  `ValueError` in order to retain backwards compatibility.

- Added a `-H` command line option which can be used to get the
  docstring of a lexer, formatter or filter.

- Made the handling of lexers and formatters more consistent. The
  aliases and filename patterns of formatters are now attributes on
  them.

- Added an OCaml lexer, thanks to Adam Blinkinsop.

- Made the HTML formatter more flexible, and easily subclassable in
  order to make it easy to implement custom wrappers, e.g. alternate
  line number markup. See the documentation.

- Added an `outencoding` option to all formatters, making it possible
  to override the `encoding` (which is used by lexers and formatters)
  when using the command line interface. Also, if using the terminal
  formatter and the output file is a terminal and has an encoding
  attribute, use it if no encoding is given.

- Made it possible to just drop style modules into the `styles`
  subpackage of the Pygments installation.

- Added a "state" keyword argument to the `using` helper.

- Added a `commandprefix` option to the `LatexFormatter` which allows
  to control how the command names are constructed.

- Added quite a few new lexers, thanks to Tim Hatch:

  * Java Server Pages
  * Windows batch files
  * Trac Wiki markup
  * Python tracebacks
  * ReStructuredText
  * Dylan
  * and the Befunge esoteric programming language (yay!)

- Added Mako lexers by Ben Bangert.

- Added "fruity" style, another dark background originally vim-based
  theme.

- Added sources.list lexer by Dennis Kaarsemaker.

- Added token stream filters, and a pygmentize option to use them.

- Changed behavior of `in` Operator for tokens.

- Added mimetypes for all lexers.

- Fixed some problems lexing Python strings.

- Fixed tickets: #167, #178, #179, #180, #185, #201.

  lexers.

- The HtmlFormatter's `get_style_defs()` can now take a list as an
  argument to generate CSS with multiple prefixes.

- Support for guessing input encoding added.

- Encoding support added: all processing is now done with Unicode
  strings, input and output are converted from and optionally to byte
  strings (see the ``encoding`` option of lexers and formatters).

- Some improvements in the C(++) lexers handling comments and line
  continuations.


Version 0.5.1
-------------
(released Oct 30, 2006)
