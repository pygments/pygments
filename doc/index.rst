Welcome!
========

This is the home of Pygments.  It is a generic syntax highlighter suitable for
use in code hosting, forums, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
source code.  Highlights are:

* a wide range of |language_count| languages and other text formats is supported
* special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting quality
* support for new languages and formats are added easily; most languages use a
  simple regex-based lexing mechanism
* a number of output formats is available, among them HTML, RTF, LaTeX and ANSI
  sequences
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library

----------

Like every open-source project, we are always looking for volunteers to help us
with programming. Python knowledge is required, but don't fear: Python is a very
clear and easy to learn language.

Development takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/pygments/pygments>`_.

If you found a bug, just open a ticket in the GitHub tracker. Be sure to log
in to be notified when the issue is fixed -- development is not fast-paced as
the library is quite stable.  You can also send an e-mail to the developers, see
below.
