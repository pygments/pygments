are:

* a wide range of over 500 languages and other text formats is supported
* special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
* support for new languages and formats are added easily
* a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image \
    formats that PIL supports and ANSI sequences
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
